#### Internet and Hosting

* The internet connects billions of devices using IP and TCP protocols.
* Web hosting keeps websites online using servers with disk space and bandwidth.
* Hosting is managed via control panels like cPanel and supports CMS tools like WordPress.
* Cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) offer scalable hosting without owning hardware.

#### Frontend vs Backend

* Frontend handles visual elements using HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JavaScript (interactivity).
* Backend manages data and logic using languages like Node.js, Python, Ruby, and Java.

#### HTML, CSS, JavaScript

* HTML adds content.
* CSS controls layout and style; preprocessors (Sass) and frameworks (Bootstrap) enhance CSS.
* JavaScript handles interactivity; frameworks (React, Vue) simplify dynamic updates.
* Bundlers (Webpack) and transpilers (TypeScript) organize and enhance JavaScript.

#### Communication and APIs

* Frontend sends requests to backend via fetch or axios.
* Backend responds after processing and storing data.
* APIs define allowed requests and responses using standard methods like GET and POST.
* REST is a common API style; alternatives include GraphQL and RPC.
* Status codes (e.g., 404) indicate request results.

#### Backend Components

* Backend frameworks (Express, Django) simplify server logic.
* Package managers (NPM, PIP) manage dependencies.
* Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) store user and product data.
* Backend and APIs run on servers or cloud infrastructure with optional load balancers and microservices.

#### Additional Technologies

* Caching (Redis), blob storage (S3), and search tools (Elastic Search) improve performance.
* Analytical databases (Snowflake) are used for reporting and data analysis.
