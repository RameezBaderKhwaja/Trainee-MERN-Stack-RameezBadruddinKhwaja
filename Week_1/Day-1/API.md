API = Application Programming Interface
→ A “contract” allowing two software components to talk.

Why use APIs?
• Reuse functionalities (e.g. Twitter, Google Maps).
• Avoid rewriting code.
• Promote separation → back-end vs front-end etc.

How they work (high-level):

Client sends a request (e.g. GET /users).

Server processes it, fetches data.

Server returns a response (usually JSON).

Client parses it and displays results.

Common types of API calls:
• GET – retrieve info
• POST – send new data
• PUT/PATCH – update existing data
• DELETE – remove data

Pro tip: Always check the documentation for endpoints, request formats, and error codes.
