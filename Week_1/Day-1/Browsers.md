Browsers take user input and turn it into web page output
The browser engine manages interactions between UI and rendering engine
The rendering engine interprets HTML CSS and JavaScript to display content
HTML is parsed into a DOM tree
CSS is parsed into a CSSOM tree
Both trees are combined into a render tree
The render tree is used to layout and paint pixels to the screen
Browsers use a critical rendering path to efficiently display content
JavaScript can block rendering if not handled correctly
Browsers use event loops to manage tasks like rendering user input and network requests
Modern browsers use multi-process architecture for better performance and security
Browsers also manage caching storage cookies and service workers
Rendering engines include Blink WebKit and Gecko
Performance is improved using techniques like lazy loading preloading and code splitting
Security is enforced through sandboxing same-origin policy and HTTPS
Browsers are constantly evolving with new APIs and features for developers
